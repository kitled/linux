# Apps (GUI)

General purpose applications for Linux (Desktop).  
I use KDE thus favor Qt over GTK.  
Flatpak preferred (no `snap` or `appimage` if I can help it).

If an app isn't listed here, it's probably in some ad hoc note — search this repo.

A good calculator; much better than the weirdly puzzling KCalc.

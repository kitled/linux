# `/opt`

The **`/opt`** directory is intended for the installation of "**add-on**" commercial and proprietary software that doesn't conform to the standard file system layout (binaries in `/usr/bin`, configuration files in `/etc`, and so on). The use of `/opt` is particularly common for large, self-contained applications, and in environments where software is frequently compiled from source. Hereâ€™s how `/opt` is typically used:

- **Self-Contained Applications**: Applications installed in `/opt` are usually stored in their own directory, such as `/opt/appname`. This directory would then contain all the necessary files for the application to run, possibly mimicking a complete file system hierarchy within.

- **Third-Party Software**: `/opt` is ideal for third-party proprietary software that does not neatly fit into the Linux system's standard directories. This keeps it separate from the system software managed by the distribution's package manager.

- **Static Applications**: Software in `/opt` is often static and does not change unless explicitly upgraded or removed by the system administrator. This makes `/opt` a good location for software that does not need frequent updates or that requires a stable, unchanging environment.



### Best Practices

- **Permissions and Ownership**: Be mindful of permissions and ownership settings in `/opt` to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that services function correctly.

- **Backup and Recovery**: Given that `/opt` may contain important software installations, it should be included in backup schedules.

- **Documentation**: Document what `/opt` should contain, internally and to the extent that users may need to interact with it.

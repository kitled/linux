### `/srv`

The `/srv` directory is intended to contain "data for services provided by the system." This directory is used to store service-specific data, which is served by the system. The organization within `/srv` is not strictly defined by the FHS, so administrators can structure this directory as needed by the services running on a system. Here are some common practices:

- **Service Data**: Each service should have its own subdirectory within `/srv`. For example, if you have a web server, you might have directories like `/srv/www` or `/srv/http` for web content.

- **Customizable Structure**: Administrators can organize `/srv` based on the name of the service (e.g., `/srv/apache`, `/srv/nginx`), or by protocol (e.g., `/srv/ftp`, `/srv/smb`), or even by domain (e.g., `/srv/example.com`, `/srv/example.org`).

- **Direct Access**: Data stored in `/srv` is often directly accessed by users or services, depending on the permissions set by the administrator.

# DAC (Digital to Analog Converter)

It takes your digital bits and transforms them to electric signals that an audio amplifier can work with. It's typically be the job of the "preamplifier" in discrete hi-fi setups. It's wired through USB usually, from the PC or phone to the DAC, then the DAC is wired through RCA cables (or XLR, if you must…) to the amplifier.

You need *something* to perform the DAC job. It's not rocket science, a good chip costs a few bucks, so you can find a perfectly transparent DAC for about $100 nowadays—it used to cost 10× that in the early naughts… Most PC sound cards do it, too. The quality might not be good depending on electrical isolation of the chip, so YMMV.



## Topping D10s / Balanced

This is what I currently use. It's a great piece of gear in my experience. Rock solid on Linux.

This is an AI summary, pretty accurate. The balanced version features balanced outs (useful if you need long cabling in the analog range, above 10m/30ft in a noisy EM environment).

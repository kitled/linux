# Audio

Two scenarios: 

1. Local (think power outlets, home listening, hifi experience)
1. Streaming (think mobile, roaming, car, radio-like)





## Local playback

Stack: "**MAD**" (MPD + ALSA + DAC)

1. [**MPD**](mpd.md) (Music Player Daemon) 
1. output to [**ALSA**](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/) (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) 
1. feeding the USB [**DAC**](DAC.md) in bit-perfect playback (PCM and DSD)

Clients (web, PC, mobileâ€¦) are used for control.

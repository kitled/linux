Audio on Linux used to be a pain, and now it's just delightful.

The stack is built on [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/) (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture), running [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/) (Music Player Daemon) to an external [DAC](DAC.md) for bit-perfect playback (PCM and DSD).

> Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a flexible, powerful, server-side application for playing music. Through plugins and libraries it can play a variety of sound files while being controlled by its network protocol.

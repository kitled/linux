## Server

### Installation

üêß`Debian` https://wiki.debian.org/NFSServerSetup

Make sure you have NFS server support in your server's kernel (kernel module named "`knfsd.ko`" or "`nfsd.ko`" under your `/lib/modules/uname -r/` directory structure). The config file will confirm if the kernel was compiled with NFS enabled.

```sh
grep NFSD /boot/config-`uname -r`
```
üñ•Ô∏è`stdout`
    ‚Æü
```
CONFIG_NFSD=m
# CONFIG_NFSD_V2 is not set
CONFIG_NFSD_V3_ACL=y
CONFIG_NFSD_V4=y
CONFIG_NFSD_PNFS=y
CONFIG_NFSD_BLOCKLAYOUT=y
# CONFIG_NFSD_SCSILAYOUT is not set
# CONFIG_NFSD_FLEXFILELAYOUT is not set
# CONFIG_NFSD_V4_2_INTER_SSC is not set
CONFIG_NFSD_V4_SECURITY_LABEL=y
```


#### Kernel-space

First, the packages.[^out1]

```sh
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server         
```

> [!Tip]
> If sharing from ZFS, you're done.  
> No need to edit `/etc/exports`.  
> You may want to setup [`ssh`](../SSH/config.md) to `send|recv`.




## Client

üÖ∞Ô∏è https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NFS#Client_configuration

### Installation

```sh
sudo apt install nfs-common
```

### Mounting

For NFSv4 mount the root NFS directory and look around for available mounts:

```sh
sudo mount servername:/ /mountpoint/on/client
```

Then mount omitting the server's NFS export root:

```sh
sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=4 servername:/music /mountpoint/on/client
```

# Linux Notes

Unlike per-file notes, to be found throughout this repository *except* in this directory at the same location of the file itself on a Linux system, these notes are titled and intended at doing a **job**, **solution** a particular problem, **actionable procedure**.

They involve by essence multiple tools and locations.

It's hard to find a one-size-fits-all structure, so it may evolve in time, but discoverability will be handled by tags in the metadata of Markdown files.

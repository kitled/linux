# Zsh (Z shell)

üèõÔ∏è https://www.zsh.org/

> Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added.

## Setup

[Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) is great for IT people and programmers. Productivity is increased by great plugins like `zsh-autosuggestions` (helps reuse & do variations on history commands).




### Installation

```sh
sudo apt install zsh zsh-doc
zsh --version    # Confirm proper installation
```

[Change your default user shell](#change-default-user-shell) if needed.  
Otherwise simply run `zsh` (right within `bash` or any other shell) to use it.

You will be greeted by the Z Shell config function for new users, `zsh-newuser-install`.  
*Hit <kbd>q</kbd> to quit if you're going to install Oh My Zsh next.*




### Configuration

Zsh is configured mostly through your **`~/.zshrc`** file, following the usual inheritance paths from the system-wide `/etc/zsh/zshrc` .  
Global Order: `zshenv`, `zprofile`, `zshrc`, `zlogin`

You can tweak lots of parameters.

#### History

Zsh has a custom tool to present history in a human-friendly way from the raw `~/.zsh_history` file.

```zsh
history
```

Near-infinite history size: in `~/.zshrc` set these parameters to a high-enough value.

```zshrc
# Number of commands to keep in memory
HISTSIZE=1000000

# Number of commands to save to the history file    
SAVEHIST=1000000
```




### Oh My Zsh!

#### Installation

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```


#### Plugins

- Overview: <https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins-Overview>
- Full list: <https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins>

Enable a plugin by adding its name to the `plugins` array in your `.zshrc` file (found in the `$HOME` directory). For example, this enables the `rails`, `git` and `ruby` plugins, in that order:

```
plugins=(rails git ruby)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Elements in zsh arrays are separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines...).  
> **DO NOT use commas.**

Whenever you install a new terminal tool on a machine, check for its [OMZ plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins).  
E.g., 
[`sudo`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/sudo),
[`cp`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/cp),
[`ssh`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/ssh),
[`ssh-agent`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/ssh-agent),
[`systemd`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/systemd) 
[`git`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git),
[`ufw`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/ufw),
[`1password`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/1password),
[`pip`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/pip),
[`ubuntu`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/ubuntu),
[`vscode`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/vscode),

> [!Tip]
> Don't add too many (strict need-to basis), as it may slow down shell startup.

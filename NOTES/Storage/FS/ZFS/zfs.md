# `zfs`

The `zfs` utility can create, destroy, and manage all existing ZFS datasets within a pool.

> [!Note]
> To manage the pool itself, use [`zpool`](zpool.md).

## Overview

‚è© `Handbook` https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs
 

## `create` & `destroy`

### Datasets

#### Canonical command

To create a dataset, use:

```sh
sudo zfs create <nameofzpool>/<nameofdataset>
```

It is then possible to apply ZFS specific attributes to the dataset.  
For example, one could assign a quota limit to a specific directory within a dataset:

```sh
sudo zfs set quota=20G <nameofzpool>/<nameofdataset>/<directory>
```

To see all the commands available in ZFS, see `zfs(8)` or `zpool(8)`.

#### Detail

‚è© https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs-create

Unlike traditional disks and volume managers, space in ZFS is *not* preallocated. With traditional file systems, after partitioning and assigning the space, there is no way to add a new file system without adding a new disk. With ZFS, creating new file systems is possible at any time. Each [*dataset*](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-term-dataset) has properties including features like compression, deduplication, caching, and quotas, as well as other useful properties like readonly, case sensitivity, network file sharing, and a mount point. Nesting datasets within each other is possible and child datasets will inherit properties from their ancestors. [Delegate](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs-allow), [replicate](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs-send), [snapshot](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs-snapshot), [jail](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs-jail) allows administering and destroying each dataset as a unit. Creating a separate dataset for each different type or set of files has advantages. The drawbacks to having a large number of datasets are that some commands like `zfs list` will be slower, and that mounting of hundreds or even thousands of datasets will slow the FreeBSD boot process.

1. Create a new dataset and enable [LZ4 compression](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-term-compression-lz4) on it:

    ```sh
    sudo zfs create -o compress=lz4 mypool/usr/mydataset
    ```

1. Destroy the created dataset:

    ```sh
    sudo zfs destroy mypool/usr/mydataset
    ```

In modern versions of ZFS, `zfs destroy` is asynchronous, and the free space might take minutes to appear in the pool. Use `zpool get freeing poolname` to see the `freeing` property, that shows which datasets are having their blocks freed in the background. If there are child datasets, like [snapshots](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-term-snapshot) or other datasets, destroying the parent is impossible. To destroy a dataset and its children, use `-r` to recursively destroy the dataset and its children. Use `-n -v` to list datasets and snapshots destroyed by this operation, without actually destroy anything. Space reclaimed by destroying snapshots is also shown.





### Volumes (zvol)

‚è© https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/#zfs-zfs-volume

A volume is a special dataset type. Rather than mounting as a file system, expose it as a block device under `/dev/zvol/poolname/dataset`. This allows using the volume for other file systems, to back the disks of a virtual machine, or to make it available to other network hosts using protocols like iSCSI or HAST.






## `send` & `receive`

### Locally

üÖ∞Ô∏è https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ZFS#Basic_ZFS_Send

First, create a snapshot of some ZFS filesystem:

```sh
sudo zfs snapshot zpool0/archive/books@snap
```

Now send the snapshot to a new location on a different zpool:

```sh
sudo zfs send -v zpool0/archive/books@snap | zfs recv zpool4/library
```

The contents of zpool0/archive/books@snap are now live at zpool4/library

> [!Tip]
> See [man zfs-send][man-zfs-send] and [man zfs-recv][man-zfs-recv] for details on flags.

### Over SSH

üÖ∞Ô∏è https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ZFS#Send_over_ssh

Use the ZFS Delegation system to allow a non-root user on each system to perform the respective send and receive operations. 

> [!Important]
> You may want to setup [`ssh`](../SSH/config.md) first.


On the sending system:

```sh
sudo zfs allow -u someuser send,snapshot mypool
```

On the receiving system:

```
# sysctl vfs.usermount=1
vfs.usermount: 0 -> 1
# echo vfs.usermount=1 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
# zfs create recvpool/backup
# zfs allow -u someuser create,mount,receive recvpool/backup
# chown someuser /recvpool/backup
```

The unprivileged user can receive and mount datasets now, and replicates the home dataset to the remote system:

```
% zfs snapshot -r mypool/home@monday
% zfs send -R mypool/home@monday | ssh someuser@backuphost zfs recv -dvu recvpool/backup
```

Create a recursive snapshot called monday of the file system dataset home on the pool mypool. Then zfs send -R includes the dataset, all child datasets, snapshots, clones, and settings in the stream. Pipe the output through SSH to the waiting zfs receive on the remote host backuphost. Using an IP address or fully qualified domain name is good practice. The receiving machine writes the data to the backup dataset on the recvpool pool. Adding -d to zfs recv overwrites the name of the pool on the receiving side with the name of the snapshot. -u causes the file systems to not mount on the receiving side. Using -v shows more details about the transfer, including the elapsed time and the amount of data transferred.

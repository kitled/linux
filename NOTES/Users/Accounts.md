# Accounts

Manage `user` accounts on Linux systems.

## Overview

User accounts are a base requiremment of most operating systems (OS): all actions ("verbs" as I call it) must be performed by a known actor ("subject" in our grammatical metaphor).

All UNIX/Linux systems begin with a user account called `root` who has full rights on the entire system. The general task of administrators (humans) is to organize a sane separation of concerns between other user accounts who have ad hoc rights to do whatever they do. The mental idea is that `root` is not a real person, it is the system itself, unhindered; and we all only borrow ad hoc root rights for ad hoc purposes. The core mantra is that having least privileges necessary for the task yields the strongest security, as all system functions are tightly gated behind credentials, out of reach from unauthorized actors.

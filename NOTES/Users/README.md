## What you need to know

The concept of users is a base requirement of most operating systems (OS):  all actions (commands) must be performed by a known actor, called `user`, with a `username` and `password`.

On Linux, all users belong to at least one group with the same name. So, user `john` is part of the `john` group, which is created at the same time as the user account.

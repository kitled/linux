# Rights

A.k.a. permissions, privileges, mode, accessâ€¦





## Mode

Default Linux permissions management in octal, over 3 bits.

`bit` (decimal) = `letter` role  
`001` (1) = `x` e**x**ecute  
`010` (2) = `w` **w**rite  
`100` (4) = `r` **r**ead  

| # | bits | text
|---|------|-----
| 0 | `000` | `---`
| 1 | `001` | `--x`
| 2 | `010` | `-w-`
| 3 | `011` | `-wx`
| 4 | `100` | `r--`
| 5 | `101` | `r-x`
| 6 | `110` | `rw-`
| 7 | `111` | `rwx`

This octal digit is known as "mode" of a file.  
The most common that make sense are 4~7. 

> [!Note]
> When not `0` (no access),

> - Readable directories are executable by principle.  
> Thus mode **`5`(`r-x`) = read-only**, or **`7`(`rwx`) = writable**.  
>
> - Files are generally **`6`(`rw-`) = writable**, or **`4`(`r--`) = read-only**;  
> executables **`5`** or **`7`** (like directories).

Linux considers three origins of access for a file, in this order:

1. `owner` user
2. `group` users
3. `other` users

Octal modes come in triplets, one for each origin.

> [!Tip]  
> **`640` (`rw- r-- ---`)** for instance means:  
> `owner` user can **read** and **write**;  
> `group` users can **only read**;  
> `other` users cannot even see.

The most common modes are:

- `600`\[`700`\] â˜› only owner can `read`+`write`\[+`execute`\].  
`rw-------`\[`rwx------`\]  
Highly secured files or directories

- `644`\[`755`\] â˜› owner can `read`+`write`\[+`execute`\], other can `read`.  
`rw-r--r--`\[`rwxr-xr-x`\]  
Typical default

- `666`\[`777`\] â˜› everyone can `read`+`write`\[+`execute`\]  
`rw-rw-rw-`\[`rwxrwxrwx`\]  
Free for all





## ACL

If you need extended rights attributes, to manage multi-user systems, consider using POSIX ACL (Access Control List).

A POSIX ACL (Access Control List) is an extended set of file attributes that lets administrators define additional user and group rights. ACLs are strictly additive, meaning they *add* rights ("whitelist"), *never deny*.

> [!Important]
> Default ACLs applied to a directory do not affect the contents in the directory which already exists.  
> Only newly written files, **after the following procedure has been done** to the dataset or directory, will benefit from these features.  
> Copying existing files on the same dataset (duplicate them) will do the trick; then delete the old copy.




### Example: give access to a second `group`

The following procedure demonstrates adding rights for a group named `media` to a dataset that belongs to another group. Adapt to suit your own needs.

> [!Tip]  
> ACL on ZFS datasets (enabled with `zfs set acltype=posixacl $DATASET_NAME` ) should be used along with its companion property `xattr=sa` which lets ZFS store these attributes in the inode (improves performance by reducing IO).

1. Install the `acl` package.

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install acl
    ```


1. The `getfacl` program lists ACLs on a file or directory.  
For example, here we list the permissions of the current directory using `ls` and see the `u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx` permission bits.

    ```sh
    ls -ld .
    ```

    ```
    drwxr-xr-x 64 jburke jburke 140 Feb  4 18:02 .
    ```


1. `getfacl` gives more verbose output.

    ```sh
    getfacl .
    ```  
    ðŸ¡³
    ```
    # file: .
    # owner: jburke
    # group: jburke
    user::rwx
    group::r-x
    other::r-x
    ```


1. To enable the `media` group to automatically have read, write, and execute permissions to new directory entries, we use the `setfacl` program.

    ```sh
    setfacl -d -m g:media:rwx .

    getfacl .
    ```
    ðŸ¡³
    ```
    # file: .
    # owner: jburke
    # group: media
    user::rwx
    group::r-x
    other::r-x
    default:user::rwx
    default:group::r-x
    default:group:media:rwx
    default:mask::rwx
    default:other::r-x
    ```

    Notice the `default:group:media` line indicating that the `media` group has `rwx` permission by default.

New files and directories created will automatically have read/write/execute permissions to all members of the `media` group.

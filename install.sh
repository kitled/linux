# Installation script for linux-notes
# https://github.com/kitled/linux

# TODO
#
#
#  1. Run in local (interactive) mode, or remote (config) mode.
#  
#      - Local "interactive" mode will ask for all the things.
#      - Remote "config" mode expects a configuration file and runs via `ssh`.
#        A safe example ("great defaults") is provided at `CONFIG/config`
#  
#  2. Whether interactively or in the config file, select features.
#  
#      - [ ] Install `note` command (for easy access to notes)
#      - [ ] Deploy system-wide (copy all notes to relevant locations)
#      - [ ] Use linux-notes for "dotfiles" management (in your fork)
#  
#  
#  3. Options.
#  
#      - [ ] Lock `note` to read-only (writable by default)
#      - [ ] Use external app to open Markdown files (`batcat` by default)
#      - [ ] 
#      - [ ] 
#      - [ ] 
#  
#  Recap, modify if necessary, then run.










# MORE STUFF, MAYBE, LATER
#    - [ ] Enable boot service (monitors changes to auto-document your notes)
